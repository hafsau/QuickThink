# Project Jam: Shortlisted Concepts

These two games have been selected for development.

---

#CONCEPT #1
# 🎪 ALIAS AUCTION

### *"I can describe it in THREE words!" "I can do it in TWO!"*

---

## The Hook

**A battle of confidence and creativity.**

Players bid on how FEW words they can use to describe something. The lowest bidder must deliver—or lose points. It's part word game, part bluffing, part watching someone sweat while trying to describe "REFRIGERATOR" in just one word.

---

## The Magic

The tension between confidence and ability creates natural drama. When someone bids "I can describe GIRAFFE in ONE word" and then says "...tallneck?"—the room decides if that counts. Arguments, laughter, judgment—it's all part of the fun.

---

## How It Works

### A Round:
1. **Word Reveal**: TV shows the target word to everyone
2. **Bidding Phase**: Players bid lower and lower word counts
3. **Challenge or Accept**: Other players can challenge or let them try
4. **Description Phase**: Lowest bidder gives their clue
5. **Group Guess**: Did it work? Group decides (or designated guesser)
6. **Scoring**: Success = points. Failure = minus points.

---

## The Magic Moment

**"The Impossible Bid"** - When someone takes "1 word" and pulls it off brilliantly. The room is in awe.

**"The Glorious Failure"** - When the confident bidder completely fails and everyone laughs. They're not upset—they're already plotting their comeback.

---

#CONCEPT #2
# ⚡ QUICK THINK

### *"Name it before the buzzer—but don't repeat anyone!"*

---

## The Hook

**Speed. Categories. Chaos.**

A category appears. A timer starts. Players type answers as fast as possible—but here's the catch: duplicates are eliminated. If two people say the same thing, NEITHER of them gets the point. Think fast, think different.

---

## The Magic

The panic of watching others type, wondering if they're typing YOUR word, the desperate search for an obscure-but-valid answer, the relief when the timer ends and your unique answer survived.

---

## How It Works

### A Round:
1. **Category Display**: TV shows "Things that are RED"
2. **Think Time**: 3 seconds to think (no typing yet)
3. **Type Phase**: 10 seconds to type ONE answer
4. **Lock In**: All answers submitted simultaneously
5. **Reveal & Eliminate**: Duplicates are crossed out, unique answers score

---

## Example Round

**Category: "Things that are RED"**

| Player | Answer | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Marcus | Apple | ❌ ELIMINATED |
| Sofia | Apple | ❌ ELIMINATED |
| Dad | Fire truck | ❌ ELIMINATED |
| Mom | Fire truck | ❌ ELIMINATED |
| Emma | Ladybug | ✅ +1 point! |
| Grandma | Lava | ✅ +1 point! |

---

## What Players Learn

| Skill | How It's Developed |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Vocabulary** | Word recall, category knowledge |
| **Quick Thinking** | Speed under pressure |
| **Creative Thinking** | Avoiding obvious answers |
| **Spelling** | Must spell correctly to count |
| **Strategy** | Risk of common vs. obscure answers |

---

## The Magic Moment

**"The Collision"** - When two players say the exact same obscure thing. "Wait, you also said CARDINAL?!" Minds blown.

**"The Obscure Win"** - When your weird, out-there answer is the ONLY unique one and you win the round.
